        <h2> Hi there </h2>
        <p> My name is OLuwatobi Obasa, also known as Tobi (an easy name to remember, right!). 
            I am a Computer Science student at the University of South Wales, and I am excited to share my journey so far with you.
            I was born and raised in South Africa, where I developed a logiacal, analytical and surpriseingly very creative mindset from a young age.
            This mindset has driven me to pursue a career in technology, where I can apply my skills to solve real-world problems.

        <p> In my free time, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and playing video games. 
            Cooking allows me to express my creativity and try new flavors, while hiking helps me connect with nature and stay active. 
            Playing video games is a fun way to unwind and challenge myself with strategic thinking and problem-solving.
